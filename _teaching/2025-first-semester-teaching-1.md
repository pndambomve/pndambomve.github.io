In this course, we study existence and uniqueness theorems for first order differential equations, as well as stability analysis for linear and nonlinear systems. 

## Existence and Uniqueness Results
We look at Picard-Lindelof local existence and uniqueness result, Cauchy-Lipschitz global existence and uniqueness result, and Peano's existence result. 

## Stability and Asymptotic Behaviour
Here, we look at conditions for stablity of the trivial equilibrium state for linear systems and the Lyapunov linearization principle for nonlinear systems.

## Boundary Value Problems
Here, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition so that a given boundary
value problem has a unique solution. We also study Green's functions and how to use them to write the solutions of BVPs.
