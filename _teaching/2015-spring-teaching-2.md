This course’s aim is to give an introduction into analytical and numerical methods for the solution of optimization problems in science and engineering. It is 
intended for students from mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science. The 
course’s focus is on continuous optimization with special emphasis on nonlinear 
programming. Besides nonlinear programming, we discuss important concepts 
from the field of convex optimization that we believe to be important to all users 
and developers of optimization methods. The course is divided into five major 
chapters: The course starts with a rigorous introduction to optimization theory 
with some Fundamental Concepts of Optimization and types of optimization prob 
lems. Next, we look at linear programming with the simplex method. Next, we look at convex optimization and the modern methods (algorithms) 
of optimization like the gradient descent, Adam etc. Next, we dive into Unconstrained Optimization and Newton Type Algorithms. The next chapter concerns Equality and inequality Constrained 
Optimization problems with KKT conditions. Key topics include the theory of first- and second-order 
optimality conditions, duality, and applications in constrained optimization. Next, we look at calculus of variation and end with optimal control theory. We 
shall illustrate the different concepts with examples to ease the understanding of 
the course. Some numerical methods for approximating solutions of optimization 
problems will also be studied and implemented in Python/Matlab.
