I am a Teacher–Researcher in Mathematics at the University of Buea, Cameroon, with a strong background in Dynamical Systems, Control Theory and Optimization. My research lies at the interface of functional differential equations, control theory, and applied optimization, with a focus on both theoretical analysis and computational approaches.

My current research activities focus on the exact and approximate boundary controllability of nonlinear functional integrodifferential equations, including systems with delay, impulses, and non-densely defined operators. I employ tools from fixed point theory, semigroup theory, and resolvent operators for integral equations in the sense of Grimmer to establish controllability results in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.

Beyond controllability problems, I am also interested in convex and nonconvex optimization problems, as well as optimal control problems, particularly those that integrate neural networks and data-driven approaches. These interests naturally connect classical control theory with modern machine learning techniques.

On the teaching side, I have experience teaching various mathematics courses to students in Mathematics, Engineering, and Data Science. I place strong emphasis on computational thinking, modeling, and the use of numerical methods to solve real-world problems.

More broadly, I am motivated by applied mathematical modeling and decision-support, with potential applications in areas such as healthcare, robotics, epidemiology, and public policy, particularly in the African context. 

I am a co-organizer of a monthly seminar on Control, Game, Decision and Learning (CoGaDeL), whose activities and research directions can be found at [https://sites.google.com/ubuea.cm/cogadel/home](https://sites.google.com/ubuea.cm/cogadel/home)
