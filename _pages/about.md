I'm a Teacher/Researcher at the University of Buea Cameroon. A Computational Functional Analyst, interested in Mathematical Control Theory of Functional Differential Equations. My current research activities deal with the study of the Approximate Controllability of Nonlinear Functional Integrodifferential Equations, using fixed point theory and Resolvent Operators for Integral Equations in the sense of Grimmer. For my publications you can check my Profile on Google Scholar. I am also interested in Monotone Iterative Methods for functional differential equations as well as in Optimal Control with Neural Networks.
